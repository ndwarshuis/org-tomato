In implmentation of the pomodoro technique in Emacs Org-Mode.

This package is not on MELPA currently. I am planning on uploading it once I iron out the bugs and sufficiently de-personalize it. If you wish to install it, please clone this repo and add to your load path.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list load-path "path/to/repo")
(require org-tomato)
#+END_SRC

* Motivation
- why does this exist when there is already org-pomodoro?
